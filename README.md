#  IoT: ESP32 + DHT22 Temperature & Humidity Monitor

This is a **beginner-level IoT project** where I used an **ESP32 microcontroller** and a **DHT22 sensor** to read temperature and humidity, and send the data to the **Arduino IoT Cloud**.  
Additionally, I included an **LED control** that can be toggled from the cloud dashboard.

##  What It Does

- Reads real-time **temperature and humidity**
- Sends sensor data to **Arduino IoT Cloud**
- Allows **LED ON/OFF** control from the cloud
- Shows data on the **dashboard or serial monitor**

##  Components Used

- ESP32 Dev Board
- DHT22 Sensor
- Breadboard, jumper wires
- Arduino IDE
